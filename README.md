# Healthcare-Dashboard
1.Project Title :

Health care Analytics Dashboard 

2.Short Description:

The Healthcare Data Analysis project utilizes Power BI to analyze and derive insights from healthcare data. The project aims to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within the data to improve decision-making and operational efficiency in healthcare organizations. By leveraging Power BI's visualization capabilities, we create interactive dashboards that provide valuable insights into patient demographics, treatment effectiveness, hospital utilization, and other key healthcare metrics.

Key Technologies and Skills

Power BI
Power Query Editor
Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
Excel

4.Features:
Data Understanding:
The healthcare dataset includes features like Date,Name, Gender, Age, Admission Type ,Discharge Date, , Mediation, Medical Condition Doctor,Room No,Test Result,Insurance Provider,Blood Type,and Hospital Satisfaction Score. These fields allow for a detailed look at visitor demographics, visit timings, and department engagement, creating a strong basis for trend analysis and operational insights.

5.Data Preprocessing:

Data Normalization and Imputation: 
In the Power Query Editor, the dataset underwent an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which included normalization by splitting tables to enhance data organization and clarity. Missing values were addressed through imputation techniques, ensuring that the dataset remained robust and reliable for analysis while maintaining consistency across various features.

DAX Calculations and Data Modeling:
Data Analysis Expressions(DAX) were utilized to create calculated fields for aggregation, allowing for sophisticated analysis of the healthcare data. This facilitated effective data modeling by establishing relationships between tables, enabling comprehensive insights and enhancing the overall interpretability of the dashboard.

6. Key Insights and Benefits:
   
Identified the patients data by using medical condition columnn data

Optimized the Billing amount with respect to insurrance provider.
